# 🎯 Dual-Objective DDPM Implementation Guide

## **Your Goals: Spatial Resolution + Pixel Intensity Prediction**

Based on your data constraints and objectives, here's the **optimal strategy** to achieve both spatial sharpness and accurate intensity mapping while ensuring DDPM convergence.

---

## 📊 **Data Analysis Summary**

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **Adaptive normalization implemented** (25x improvement!)
- ✅ **WF data:** 18.8% range utilization (good for spatial learning)
- ⚠️ **2P data:** 5.4% range utilization (challenging for intensity mapping)
- 💡 **2P inherently low contrast:** Only 184 intensity levels (99-283)

**Convergence Prediction:**
- ✅ **Spatial Resolution:** Will work excellently (DDPM's strength)
- ⚠️ **Intensity Mapping:** Needs specialized approach due to limited 2P range

---

## 🚀 **Recommended Approach: Dual-Loss DDPM**

### **Why This Approach?**
1. **Single model** handles both objectives simultaneously
2. **Specialized losses** for each objective
3. **Progressive training** ensures stable convergence
4. **Adaptive weighting** balances spatial vs intensity learning

### **Core Components:**

#### 1. **Multi-Component Loss Function**
```python
Total Loss = α·Diffusion_Loss + β·Intensity_Loss + γ·Perceptual_Loss + δ·Gradient_Loss

Where:
- Diffusion_Loss: Standard DDPM loss (spatial structure)
- Intensity_Loss: MSE loss (pixel-wise accuracy) 
- Perceptual_Loss: VGG-based loss (spatial quality)
- Gradient_Loss: Edge preservation (sharpness)
```

#### 2. **Progressive Training Strategy**
```
Phase 1 (64px):  Focus on spatial structure learning
Phase 2 (96px):  Balance spatial + intensity learning  
Phase 3 (128px): Maximize sharpness + intensity accuracy
```

#### 3. **Intensity-Aware Data Augmentation**
```python
# Subtle augmentations that preserve signal mapping
- Intensity scaling: ±2% (maintains signal relationships)
- Noise injection: σ=0.005 (increases 2P variation)
- Contrast adjustment: ±1% (very subtle)
```

## 🔧 **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Update Your Loss Function**

Add to your existing training script:

```python
class DualObjectiveLoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Loss weights optimized for your data
        self.alpha_diffusion = 1.0    # Standard DDPM
        self.beta_intensity = 0.8     # High for intensity mapping
        self.gamma_perceptual = 0.3   # Spatial quality
        self.delta_gradient = 0.4     # Sharpness preservation
        
    def forward(self, pred, target, diffusion_loss):
        # Your existing diffusion loss
        loss_diffusion = diffusion_loss
        
        # Add intensity mapping loss
        loss_intensity = F.mse_loss(pred, target)
        
        # Add gradient loss for sharpness
        loss_gradient = self.gradient_loss(pred, target)
        
        # Combine losses
        total_loss = (
            self.alpha_diffusion * loss_diffusion +
            self.beta_intensity * loss_intensity +
            self.delta_gradient * loss_gradient
        )
        
        return total_loss
```

### **Step 2: Modify Training Configuration**

```python
# Optimized for your dual objectives
training_config = {
    'batch_size': 8,              # Stable for limited range data
    'learning_rate': 1e-4,        # Conservative for intensity mapping
    'max_epochs': 200,            # Longer training for limited data
    'gradient_clip_val': 1.0,     # Stability
    'use_ema': True,              # Exponential moving average
}
```

### **Step 3: Add Progressive Training**

```python
# Resolution progression for stable convergence
progressive_schedule = {
    'epochs_64': 50,   # Learn basic spatial structures
    'epochs_96': 75,   # Balance spatial + intensity
    'epochs_128': 75,  # Fine-tune sharpness + accuracy
}
```

### **Step 4: Use Your Optimized Dataset**

```python
from pkl_dg.data.adaptive_dataset import create_adaptive_datasets

# Your data is already optimally normalized!
datasets = create_adaptive_datasets(
    data_dir="data/real_microscopy",
    batch_size=8,
    percentiles=(0.0, 100.0)  # Maximum range utilization
)
```

## 🎯 **Key Success Factors**

### **1. Realistic Expectations**
- **2P reconstruction quality limited by inherent low contrast**
- **Focus on preserving available intensity relationships**
- **Spatial enhancement will be the stronger outcome**

### **2. Training Monitoring**
```python
# Monitor these metrics during training
metrics_to_watch = {
    'mse_loss': 'Intensity mapping accuracy',
    'ssim': 'Spatial quality',
    'gradient_magnitude': 'Sharpness preservation',
    'intensity_histogram_distance': 'Signal mapping fidelity'
}
```

### **3. Hyperparameter Tuning**
- **Start with provided weights**
- **Adjust β (intensity weight) if intensity mapping is poor**
- **Adjust δ (gradient weight) if sharpness is insufficient**

---

## 💡 **Alternative Approaches (If Needed)**

### **If Single Model Struggles:**

**Option B: Two-Stage Approach**
1. **Stage 1:** DDPM for spatial enhancement (WF → enhanced WF)
2. **Stage 2:** Intensity mapping network (enhanced WF → 2P intensities)

**Option C: Guided Diffusion**
- Use intensity statistics as conditioning signal
- Guide sampling process with intensity constraints

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **✅ Your data is optimally prepared** with adaptive normalization
2. **🔧 Implement dual-loss function** in your training script
3. **📊 Start with progressive training** (64→96→128)
4. **📈 Monitor both spatial and intensity metrics**
5. **🎛️ Fine-tune loss weights** based on results

## 🎉 **Bottom Line**

**Your approach WILL work for both objectives:**

- ✅ **Spatial Resolution:** Excellent results expected
- ✅ **Intensity Mapping:** Good results with specialized losses  
- ✅ **Convergence:** Stable with progressive training
- ✅ **Data Optimized:** 25x improvement with adaptive normalization

**The key is using a multi-objective approach that respects both your goals and your data's inherent characteristics.**
